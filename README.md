This documentation is intended to introduce the general user to the project, as well as to serve as a guide for anyone who may be developing software using Gstake.

## What is Gstake

Gstake is a liquid staking solution for DePIN, currently supports [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/), and will continue to support [Livepeer](https://livepeer.org/), [Streamr](https://streamr.network/) and other DePIN networks.

## What is liquid staking? <a href="#what-is-liquid-staking" id="what-is-liquid-staking"></a>

Liquid staking allows users to mint a token that represents their staked assets and grows in value as staking rewards accrue. The token will have wide acceptance in Defi and hence allow users to participate in both securing the network via staking and pursue Defi.

## What is DePIN?

DePINs, or Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks, are networks that use token incentives to motivate individuals to share their resources. This sharing of resources covers a wide range of areas, including storage, communications traffic, cloud computing, energy, etc. DePINs have transformed infrastructure provision by centralized enterprises into a form of crowdsourcing that involves users worldwide.
