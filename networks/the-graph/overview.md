Gstake has developed the first decentralized liquidity staking protocol for The Graph protocol, providing a new option for GRT stakers. Gstake can increase the capital utilization rate of GRT stakers, reduce the learning cost of staking, shorten the time to unstake, and provide a more stable APY. Gstake will be the first step in introducing the GRT token to more DeFi protocols.

There are two ways to participate in the staking of The Graph protocol, namely Indexer and Delegator. For more information about Indexer and Delegator, please refer to The Graph protocol documentation. Gstake participates in the staking of The Graph protocol by implementing a set of decentralized Delegators, and may upgrade to reduce staking fees through Indexer in the future.
