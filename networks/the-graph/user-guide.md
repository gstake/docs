# User Guide

In order to reduce transaction fees, The Graph is currently migrating from Ethereum to Arbitrum one. In the future, the majority of The Graph's staking volume will be concentrated on Arbitrum one, hence Gstake has chosen to deploy on the Arbitrum one mainnet.

## How to stake GRT?

1. Connect your wallet and switch the network to Arbitrum one.
2. Stake your GRT. &#x20;

2. Wait for Gstake to redeem GRT from The Graph.

The waiting time for redemption depends on the amount of GRT being redeemed. If the redemption amount is less than or equal to the temporary storage amount of the Gstake protocol (the amount of GRT not yet processed by Gstake), the waiting time will be less than one day. If the redemption amount is greater than the temporary storage amount of the Gstake protocol, the waiting time will be 28 days.

3. Complete the redemption and claim your GRT.
